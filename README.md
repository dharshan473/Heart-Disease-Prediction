# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project aims to develop a robust heart disease prediction system using logistic regression. By analyzing critical factors such as age, sex, cholesterol levels, and other health-related data, the model will predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The goal is to create a reliable tool for early detection, potentially improving patient outcomes and saving lives
